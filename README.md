# No-Flappy-Just-Buggy
Some fun with p5.js creating a platform game

# Inspiration
I was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY

# How to run it

Because passing my sketch on p5.js editor sometimes give 404 error: https://editor.p5js.org/TigaxMT/sketches/rqhdIkEid

You can play it locally running a simple local server. I used python, just open a terminal inside of the game folder and run this command: 

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

If you want to know how run a local server with different tools check this: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server

Then just access your local server via browser ( in case of python ) -> http://localhost:8000
